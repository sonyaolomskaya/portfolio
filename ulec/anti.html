	The last poster, titled 'Anti-Government,' focuses on the opposing side of media networks. Primarily taking inspiration from the book by Valeria Sperling, "Sex, Putin & Politics." Pussy Riot was a group of young women who were "self-proclaimed Russian feminists" (Page 224, Sex, Putin & Politics) in 2012. They were anti-Putin and believed in feminism and LGBTQ rights. Pussy Riot displays a different perspective on media as "their main audience is the media themselves" (Page 237, Sex, Putin & Politics). Russia is anti-LGBTQ; thus, Pussy Riots protests got a lot of attention and quickly went viral. The media, at this point, was covering precisely what Russia was against. The networks covering Pussy Riot were so shocked by their oppositions, and this is when the point of view of people watching the media suddenly flipped to the media watching them. This poster portrays a fight, as Pussy Riot did for themselves and their community. Where they took advantage of the press to let themselves be heard. Compared to the other two posters where we see how media can be used as a form of propaganda, this poster also shows how media can be used as a tool to oppose the government and highlights the consequences that may come along with that. As Russia does not practice freedom of speech as The United States does, one could say that authoritarian discourse is present on a larger scale in Russia.

	As Pussy Riot was a more recent group, we can still see how media portrays the opposition and resilience of the Russian people going back to the twentieth century. The film "Stilyagi" was released in 2008 and was set in Moscow during the 1950s. This film highlights how a minority group, in this case, "hipsters" opposed anti-western propaganda. Movies, shows, and documentaries are another form of media that is important to highlight. Stilyagi portrays how propaganda was used back in the twentieth century. However, it can also create connections to the world we live in today. This poster highlights the opposition to propaganda as well as the consequences that have been faced by protestors.
