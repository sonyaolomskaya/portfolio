	The poster 'Social Media Information Warfare' takes inspiration from the documentaries "The Great Hack" and "Agents of Chaos" along with the book "Network Propaganda" by Benkler Yochai. In 2016 during the United States presidential election, Donald Trump worked together with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm from the United Kingdom. During this alliance, social media, specifically Facebook and Twitter, were used as a tool to manipulate covertly and surreptitiously influence the public. There were "tens of millions of Facebook profiles to develop techniques for manipulating voters" (Page 11, Network Propaganda). Cambridge Analytica, together with Trump, collected data on behavior, characteristics, and backgrounds about different communities to manipulate voters using their personal information, also known as "information warfare" (The Great Hack). This poster portrays an abstract yet direct way to display how social media platforms were weaponized and used as a form of propaganda without people's knowledge. Cambridge Analytica "targeted those whose minds we thought we could change, until they saw the whose we wanted them to," which is a critical message in portraying the real goals and targets of social media propaganda within this poster.

	However, the United States is not the only one to participate in and initiate social media usage as a form of manipulation and information warfare. Online social networking services have more power than we recognize as they allow for anonymity and rather personal connections between our internet personas, which lead to a greater sense of trust. "Facebook and Twitter automated accounts, which incited people on both the left and the right to protest" (Page 10, Network Propaganda) was a way in which Russia played its role in manipulating voters during the 2016 elections in the United States. The Agents of Chaos documentary goes into detail about how Russia used troll farms, which were social media automated "troll" accounts that appeared to be real people but were, in fact, bots during the 2016 United States presidential elections and in the years following. Although the troll farms were not connected to Cambridge Analytica, they developed their manipulation techniques through social media to deceive and misinform people. Furthermore, they targeted vulnerable communities such as supporters and populations of the Black Lives Matter movement. "Russian propaganda campaign just kept going even after President Trump won the election" (Agents of Chaos). However, the troll farms played a part in using deceitful information to manipulate communities during the elections; it did not stop once the elections were over. This poster intends to highlight how social media networks can be used as a weapon for information warfare—exploiting personal data to benefit the authorities of Russia and The United States while deceiving and covertly using social media to their advantage.
