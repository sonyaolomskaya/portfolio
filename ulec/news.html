	The poster 'Politics and Media' takes inspiration from the text by Yurchak and Boyer "American Stiob" as well as "Road to Unfreedom" by Timothy Snyder and "Soviet Active Measures and Disinformation" by Dennis Kux. The first poster was designed with its main focus being social media to portray the deception within social network propaganda. At the same time, this work looks at television networks as its primary focus. Going back to the 1960s, "disinformation" involving "various practices, including circulating false or misleading news stories" (Page 23, Soviet Active Measures and Disinformation) could be identified within Russian television networks. Although the world was different in the twentieth century, with television networks producing communist stories, we can still identify how authority plays a large role in media today. One of the largest Russian television channels is NTV. There is a pattern in the way governments take advantage of media for their benefits. Media and politics have a compelling connection with one another. Snyder wrote, "The Russian television channel NTV warned of "homodictatorship" in Ukraine" (Page 53, Road to Unfreedom). This instance traces back to Russia intervening in Ukraine's politics by falsely misleading citizens to contemplate "taboo" sex. This poster highlights how television networks can mislead and exaggerate news, which works for the Russian government's benefit. Furthermore, a music video titled "One like Putin" was released, which portrays two women praising Putin on television. This further informs that television networks can be used in different ways as a form of propaganda. Although the release of this music video most likely had no direct involvement of Putin himself, it develops a commentary on how television networks have the power to formulate convincing and manipulative narratives for populations. This poster incorporates the different ways television networks in Russia use propaganda as a tool for manipulation while contrasting with media from The United States.

	Yurchak and Boyer compared parody like media and their approach to covering politics in the United States. There is a pattern of predictable and repetitive forms of authoritative discourse within large US media networks such as CNN, Fox News, and NBC. 	"Even the casual viewer can see that The Daily Show is not only a parody of "real" political news on CNN, Fox, NBC, and other "serious" channels but that it also provides an elaborate commentary on how mainstream media organize their coverage of politics" (Page 192, American Stiob). This poster incorporates the contrast of how media networks provide new opinions "for a whole generation of Americans" (Page 191, American Stiob). News sources are not always reliable, especially large corporations that are in favor of governments. Furthermore, they are highly over-consumed. However, it is hard to tell the difference between propaganda and truth, as Snyder believes, "objectivity is a myth" (Page 53, Road to Unfreedom). Comparing different television networks and their approaches highlight how we may be missing the repetitive circulation of disinformation in media. Russia and The United States are both guilty in their use of media as a form of propaganda, whether that may be through misinforming the public of their opponents or repeatedly deceiving populations to believe a subjective statement.
