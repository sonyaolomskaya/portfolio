<h1>ARTIST</h1>
<h2>STATEMENT</h2>
<p> Through the exploration of motion, sound and cg, I have created an album cover for every month of the year 2020. Each cover takes you on a journey of that month, with sound assisting your emotive responses to them. Through researching the relationships between sound and emotions as well as motion and emotions, I developed each album cover to take on a world of it's own while still holding a connection with one another. Each month has a unique and abstract perspective on the events, emotions, and sounds that relate to them. Some portray and incorporate global events whilst others have more personal portrayals. Sound plays a big role in our lives, whether it's the music we listen to or the ambient noises we hear around us. Each cover treats sound as a part of it's world, assisting and guiding the journey. </p>
