<p class="scroll-down"> Through the exploration of motion, sound and 3D design, I have created an album cover for every month of the year 2020. Each cover takes you on a journey of that month, with sound assisting your emotive responses to them. </br> </br> Through researching the relationships between sound and motion to emotions, I developed each album cover to take on a world of its own while still holding a connection with one another. These connections are displayed through shapes and treatment of visual elements as well as the incorporation of typography into each scene. Each month has a unique and abstract perspective on the events, emotions, and sounds that relate to them. </br> </br> Some portray and incorporate global events whilst others have more personal portrayals. Sound plays a big role in our lives, whether it's the music we listen to or the ambient noises we hear around us. Each cover treats sound as a part of its world, assisting and guiding the journey.  </br> </br> This website acts as a place for the videos to live, elevating their existence in digital space through the navigation of the site. The covers can be viewed in a Calendar style where they can have a closer relationship to one another as well as in a Timeline format where each video can have a space of it's own. Furthemore, you are brought into the world of these videos through the landing page where a compliation of elements act as an entrance to the project.
